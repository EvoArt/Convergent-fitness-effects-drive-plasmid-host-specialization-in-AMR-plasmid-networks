## Data code

### main experiment analysis

All code and data for analysis of plasmid and bacteria densities and interaction networks in the main experment.

### fitness effects

All code and data used in Figure 1 - effects of plasmids on host fitness.

## Model code
### population-based model 
Figure code in `model_plot.jl` uses data generated by `sims_all.jl` and `sims_one.jl`.

### individual-based model
Figure code in `agents_plot.jl` uses data generated by `agents.jl` run using bash script `agents.sh` on a Slurm cluster manager.
